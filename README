This repository contains two formalisations of the syntax of binding signatures
1. one in hol, with a specific example of lambda-calculus
1. one in coq

See the corresponding subdirectories for a more precise description of each one.

After checking the repository for the same time, use 
`git submodule update --init --recursive`
to download the hol formalisation.

Later, to pull the coq and hol last versions at the same time, use
`git pull --recurse-submodules`
